# Engineering_Growth_Workshop
Sandbox for Improving code development


### Zack and Jared - This is for you both to commit code to.
***You are both at similar points in your education, so it should help a lot to bounce ideas off each other and view each others code. The ultimate goal is to improve, so try everything even if it seems stupid or slow. I'll help if I can and put comments if I see you could make something better.***
